This library provides output iterators that enrich and complement the ones of the STL, such as `std::back_inserter`.

All iterators are located in the namespace `fluent`.

#`sorted_inserter`

In the majority of cases where it is used in algoritms, `std::inserter` forces its user to provide a position. It makes sense for un-sorted containers such as `std::vector`, but for sorted containers such as `std::set` we end up choosing begin or end by defult, which doesn't make sense:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 3, -4, 2, 7, 10, 8};
std::set<int> results;
std::copy(begin(v), end(v), std::inserter(results, end(results)));
```

`sorted_inserter` removes this constraint by making the position optional. If no hint is passed, the containers is left to determine the correct position to insert:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 3, -4, 2, 7, 10, 8};
std::set<int> results;
std::copy(begin(v), end(v), sorted_inserter(results));

//results contains { -4, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10 }
```

#`custom_inserter`

`custom_inserter` takes a function (or function object) that inserts into an arbitrary output container. The purpose of this iterator is to give legacy code that does not use STL containers access to STL algorithms:

```cpp
std::vector<int> input = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ,8, 9, 10};

void legacyInsert(int number, DarkLegacyStructure const& thing); // this function inserts into the old non-STL container

DarkLegacyStructure legacyStructure = // ...

std::copy(begin(input), end(input), custom_inserter([&legacyStructure](int number){ legacyInsert(number, legacyStructure); });
```

#`map_aggregator`

`map_aggregator` provides the possibility to embark an aggregator function in the inserter iterator, so that new elements whose **key is already present in the map** can be merged with the existent (e.g. have their values added together).

```cpp
std::vector<std::pair<int, std::string>> entries = { {1, "a"}, {2, "b"}, {3, "c"}, {4, "d"} };
std::vector<std::pair<int, std::string>> entries2 = { {2, "b"}, {3, "c"}, {4, "d"}, {5, "e"} };
std::map<int, std::string> results;

std::copy(entries.begin(), entries.end(), map_aggregator(results, concatenateStrings));
std::copy(entries2.begin(), entries2.end(), map_aggregator(results, concatenateStrings));

// results contains { {1, "a"}, {2, "bb"}, {3, "cc"}, {4, "dd"}, {5, "e"} };
```

`set_aggreagator` provides a similar functionality for aggregating elements into sets.

#`output_transformer`

`output_transformer` is an output iterator that wraps around another output iterator. It embarks a function `f` and, when it receives a value, applies `f` on it and sends the result to the output iterator that it is wrapping.

The helper function `make_output_transformer` takes a function and returns an `output_transformer` embarking (a copy of) that function.

```cpp
std::vector<int> input = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

auto const times2 = make_output_transformer([](int i) { return i*2; });

std::vector<int> results;
std::copy(begin(input), end(input), times2(std::back_inserter(results)));

// results contains {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
```

#`output_transformer`

`output_transformer` is an output iterator that wraps around another output iterator. It embarks a function `f` and, when it receives a value, applies `f` on it and sends the result to the output iterator that it is wrapping.

The helper function `make_output_transformer` takes a function and returns an `output_transformer` embarking (a copy of) that function.

```cpp
std::vector<int> input = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

auto const times2 = make_output_transformer([](int i) { return i*2; });

std::vector<int> results;
std::copy(begin(input), end(input), times2(std::back_inserter(results)));

// results contains {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
```


#output_partitioner

`output_partitioner` is an output iterator that takes a predicate and 2 other output itertors. It routes the data it receives over to either one of these iterators, depending on whether that piece of data satisfies the predicate.
It can be built with the helper function `make_output_partitioner`:

```cpp
std::vector<int> input = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

auto const isEvenPartition = fluent::make_output_partitioner([](int n){ return n % 2 == 0; });

std::vector<int> evens;
std::vector<int> odds;

std::copy(begin(input), end(input), isEvenPartition(std::back_inserter(evens), std::back_inserter(odds)));

// evens contains {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
// odds contains {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};

```

#`dead_end_iterator`

`dead_end_iterator` is an iterator that doesn't do anything with the value it receives. It is useful for selecting only some data coming out of an algorithm that has several outputs.
An example of such algorithm is [`set_segregate`](https://github.com/joboccara/sets).
